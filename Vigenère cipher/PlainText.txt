Grass in your hair
Stretched like a lion in the sun
Restlessly turned
Moistened your mouth with your tongue
Pouring my wine
In your eyes caged mine, glowing
Touching your face my
Fingers strayed knowing
I called you lady of the dancing water
Blown autumn lady of the dancing water
Blown autumn leaves
Shed to the fire where you laid me
Burn slow to ash
Just as my days now seem to be
I feel you still
Always your eyes glowing
Remembered hours
Salt, earth and flowers flowing
Farewell, my lady of the dancing water
